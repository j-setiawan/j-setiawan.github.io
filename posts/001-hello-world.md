Years of using Markdown for documentation (Obsidian, ADRs, etc.) have influenced me to build a Markdown-based static site. I settled on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) using the [high performance template](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog).

I only plan to display my resume on this site, but this theme requires a post and, rather than ripping out all the blogging support and realizing I want it later, I chose to write into the ether.
